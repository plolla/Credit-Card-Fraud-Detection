# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

I will attempt to use data science to identify and predict fradulent transactions using data from transactions of European cardholders in September 2013. In this repository, you will find a file where I test classic machine learning models, like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. You will also find another file, where I try to use deep learning to predict fraud.
